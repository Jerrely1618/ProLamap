## The Power of the Human Brain

The human brain can hold up **2.5 Petabytes (PB)** of information—whole libraries of raw data. Yet, we forget. As software engineers, new technologies are made each day, from incredible ones like **Rust** to mindblowing ones like **D# (DogeSharp)**. It’s easy to forget them all. **To conclude this paragraph in a sentence:**

> Life is fleeting and so are our thoughts.

The purpose of Re is to hold the crucial languages, algorithms, and data structures for you to:

- **Learn**
- **Remember**
- **Reapply** into your code

Our goal is to put in the hands of everyone the knowledge of programming. Think of it as a dictionary for all the programming knwoledge with languages, algorithms and data structure whenever you need them. A goodbye to searching **10 websites** and **5 tutorials** to find how to apply **Dijkstra's algorithm** (or in my case, how to spell it).

With **Re**, you can search it up fast and reliably.
